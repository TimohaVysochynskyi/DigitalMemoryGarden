            <br />
            <br />
            The war changed everything. As the creator of this platform - and
            like many Ukrainians - I felt the need to preserve the moments we
            were living through, not just the history, but the emotions, the
            voices, the silences. At first, I imagined creating a printed book,
            a quiet place to gather wartime stories. But over time, I realised
            that memory today lives not only on pages - it lives online, across
            borders, and across generations.
            <br />
            <br />
            That’s how the idea for the Digital Memory Garden was born. A
            living, interactive space where memory can be shared, honoured, and
            kept - through stories, sounds, drawings, and gestures.
          </p>
          <p className={css.text}>
            <span className={css.sectionTitle}>For Ukraine, for the World</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            This platform is for everyone touched by the war - directly or from
            afar.
            <br />
            <br />
            For Ukrainians, for the diaspora, for those who want to witness,
            understand, support. It’s a digital place where grief can be
            expressed gently, and memory can be planted like a seed.
          </p>
          <p className={css.text}>
            <span className={css.sectionTitle}>Why We Remember</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            We believe memory is not just history - it’s care. Behind every
            photo, audio clip, or flickering candle on this platform is a
            person. A life paused by conflict but not erased. Here, storytelling
            becomes an act of defiance. Memory becomes action. And design
            becomes the bridge between silence and solidarity.

            This is not a museum. Not a government archive. Not a one-way
            display. It’s a space built by people - for people. It’s emotional,
            not institutional. Interactive, not static.
            <br />
            <br />
            Every flower planted here tells a story. Every lit candle honours
            someone. Every contribution - whether big or small - is part of a
            collective act of remembrance. It’s the first platform of its kind
            in Ukraine that treats memory not only as documentation but as
            shared experience. It grows, shifts, and responds - like memory
            itself.

            Anonymity is always an option. Sensitive content is marked, and

            safe and respectful for everyone.
