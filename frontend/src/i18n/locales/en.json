We explore why platforms like The Digital Memory Garden matter - for healing, connection, and history - and how they help keep memory alive in times of war and displacement.",

      "description": "Lana Sokoliuk is the creator of The Digital Memory Garden and a student of the Digital Media Design Master's programme at the University of Edinburgh. Her creative and academic work is driven by a deep interest in preserving collective memory, symbolic forms of storytelling, and designing emotionally intelligent, interactive platforms. This project was born from the belief that memory should not disappear in silence — it should be nurtured, shared, and held with care. The Digital Memory Garden is her way of transforming grief and remembrance into a participatory digital space.",
      "quote": "Some memories are too fragile to be shouted, but too important to be lost. This space was built to hold them gently - to give people a way to speak without fear, to remember without noise, and to let stories grow quietly where they won’t be forgotten."
